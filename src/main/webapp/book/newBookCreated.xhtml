                <h1>A new book has been created</h1>
                This example shows a typical double-submit problem.
                If you refresh this page, the new post request gets
                generated again causing double-submit problem.
                This occurs because the URL still points to
                newBook.xhtml even though the contents of this
                page is from newBookCreated.xhtml.

                As an experiment, just refresh this page a couple
                of times and then go to the BOOK table of the database
                and you will see the multiple rows are created.

                The solution to this problem is doing a redirect
                so that even the URL points to the newBookCreated.xhtml.
